# FriendBook
A demo social media site. 

Allows users to set up profiles, start blogs, and purchase items in the market page that
makes their avatar stronger. 

# REQUIREMENTS
Python3
Django
Pillow
  

# SETUP
In order to start the development server,
1) Clone the project and install Django, Pillow.
2) Navigate to FriendBook/FriendBook (this directory should contain manage.py)
3) Enter the command: ```python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80```
This should tell the django development server to start on port 80 and accept all requests. 
It does not support https. An actual server component is needed for that.
