# FriendBook
A demo social media site. 

# REQUIREMENTS
Python3

Pip

  Pip -> Django
  
  Pip -> Pillow
  

# SETUP
In order to start the development server,
1) After cloning and getting the environment setup,
2) Navigate to FriendBook/FriendBook (this directory should contain manage.py)
3) Enter the command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
This should tell the django development server to start on port 80 and accept all requests. 
It does not support https. An actual server component is needed for that.
